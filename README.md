Technology
-----------
We use C# (tested on Windows, not Mono) with OpenCV (for .NET).

Developers
----------

To get started, there's all kinds of indentation issues in the codebase, fix those so you can get a feel for how all the code is laid out.

Standards
---------

We use tabs-as-spaces, with 4 spaces for identation. There's all kinds of identation issues, and we encourage people to fix those.

Ports
---------
The current code only runs on Windows, under the CLR virtual machine (i.e. C#). 
If you're working on a port to a different environment (*nix, Mac OS X, Android, etc.) please list it here, with some kind of link to code.
